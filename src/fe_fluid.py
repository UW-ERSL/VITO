"""Fluid flow solver for Navier-Stokes equations in dimensional form.

This module implements a finite element solver for the steady-state,
incompressible Navier-Stokes equations on a domain Ω, incorporating a
Brinkman penalty term to model fluid flow through porous media. This is
commonly used in topology optimization to represent solid regions as areas of
very low permeability.

The governing equations in their strong form are:

Momentum conservation:
    ρ(u ⋅ ∇)u - ∇ ⋅ (μ(∇u + (∇u)ᵀ)) + ∇p - αu = 0

Mass conservation (incompressibility):
    ∇ ⋅ u = 0

with appropriate boundary conditions on Γ.

  u   : velocity field
  p   : pressure field
  ρ   : fluid density
  μ   : dynamic viscosity
  α   : Brinkman penalty (inverse permeability)

Brinkman Penalty:
  • The α term penalizes velocity in regions designated as solid, effectively
    enforcing a no-slip condition. In fluid regions, α is zero (or very small).
    This approach allows for a single-domain formulation for fluid-solid
    interaction problems typical in topology optimization.

Stabilization:
  The formulation is implemented with stabilized finite elements to handle
  convection-dominated flows. Specifically, it uses:
  • Streamline-Upwind/Petrov-Galerkin (SUPG) for the convective terms.
  • Pressure-Stabilizing/Petrov-Galerkin (PSPG) for the pressure gradient terms.

    """Returns the stabilization parameter for SUPG term.

      This function computes the stabilization parameter (τ) used in
        convection-diffusion-reaction problems computed for each element.
      The stabilization parameter (τ) is computed using an approximate minimum
        function considering three limiting cases:

      - τ₁: Convective limit
      - τ₃: Diffusive limit
      - τ₄: Reactive limit

      The reactive limit (τ₄) is especially important for ensuring stability in
      the solid domain and at the interface, particularly for large Brinkman penalty
      parameters.
      The stabilization parameter is assumed constant within each element, and
      τ₁ is computed based on the velocity components evaluated at the element centroid.

      Stabilization parameter (τ) is computed as:

      τ = ( τ₁⁻² + τ₃⁻² + τ₄⁻² )^(-1/2)

      Where:
      τ₁ = h / ( 2√(uᵢ uᵢ) )   # Convective limit
      τ₃ = ρh² / (12μ)         # Diffusive limit
      τ₄ = ρ / α              # Reactive limit
      τ_2 is the transient limit and ignored

    The weak form is expressed as follows:

    Integral Terms:
    ----------------
    First term: Represents the convection term in the weak form:
      ∫_Ω ρ w_i (u_j ∂u_i / ∂x_j) dV
      where ρ is the mass density, w_i is the shape function, and u_i is the velocity.

    Second term: Represents the viscous diffusion term:
      ∫_Ω μ (∂w_i / ∂x_j) (∂u_i / ∂x_j + ∂u_j / ∂x_i) dV
      where μ is the dynamic viscosity.

    Third term: Represents the pressure term:
      ∫_Ω (∂w_i / ∂x_i) p dV
      where p is the pressure field.

    Fourth term: Represents the Brinkman penalization (Darcy friction) term:
      ∫_Ω α w_i u_i dV
      where α is the inverse permeability (related to the Darcy number).

    Last terms: SUPG stabilization term:
      ∫_Ωe τ w_k (∂u_i / ∂x_k) (ρ u_j ∂u_i / ∂x_j + ∂p / ∂x_i + α u_i) dV
      where τ is the stabilization parameter to handle convection-dominated problems.

    The stabilization terms are added using Streamline Upwind Petrov-Galerkin (SUPG)
      method to enhance stability by adding artificial diffusion in the streamline
      direction, especially important for higher Reynolds number flows.

    - First term: Represents the weak form of mass conservation (continuity equation):
      ∫_Ω q (∂u_i / ∂x_i) dV
      where `q` is the test function for pressure, and `u_i` is the velocity field.

    - last three terms: PSPG stabilization term:
      ∑_e ∫_Ωe τ (ρ ∂q / ∂x_i) (u_j ∂u_i / ∂x_j + ∂p / ∂x_i + α u_i) dV
      where:
        - `τ` is the PSPG stabilization parameter.
        - `ρ` is the density.
        - `u_i` is the velocity vector.
        - `p` is the pressure field.
        - `α` is the inverse permeability (related to the Darcy number).
      This term enhances stability by adding pressure stabilization, which is
      crucial for avoiding numerical issues such as pressure oscillations in mixed
      formulations, especially in convection-dominated flows.
